## 🔁 Philosophical Note

xAr's folder logic mirrors the framework itself:

- **Framework = Core**
- **Docs = Soul**
- **Toolkit = Movement**
- **Diagrams = Symbol**
- **Research = Proof**
- **Translations = Expansion**

> If you can’t **navigate** a methodology, you’ll never **trust** it.  
> This repo is structured so clarity becomes the culture.
