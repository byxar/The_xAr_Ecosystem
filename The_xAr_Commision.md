## 👁️ Overview

The **xAr Commission™** is the codified oath of the xAr Ecosystem. It contains 11 brutal, non-negotiable rules that every founder, operator, creative, and strategist must follow to build a real business — not a performance.

Each rule is linked to a pillar in the xAr Ecosystem: Earth (Business), Air (Brand), Water (Flow), Fire (User), and Aether (Space). The final rule is the binding force: **Speed + Iteration**.

These rules must be understood, embodied, and enforced. Projects that skip them — collapse. Teams that follow them — scale.
