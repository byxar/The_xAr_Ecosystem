# xAr Framework™ and Ecosystem™: Framework Comparison

This table compares the xAr Framework™ and Ecosystem™, developed by Amr Radwan in 2025, against 20 retail and brand experience frameworks to assess its originality. The xAr Framework™ is a multidisciplinary methodology for retail design and brand experience, structured around five pillars (Business, Brand, Flow, User, Space) and four lenses (Art, Science, Design, Engineering), using elemental metaphors (Earth, Air, Water, Fire, Aether/Space). The comparison evaluates structure, metaphors, ecosystem terminology, spiritual/practical integration, and real-world validation as of July 31, 2025.
