#  xAr Ecosystem™ Documentation
Welcome to the official `/doc` folder for the **xAr Ecosystem™** GitHub repository.

This folder contains all research, methodology, terminology, and validation files that support the framework’s originality, academic grounding, and applied relevance.

##  Purpose of This Folder

This documentation serves 3 key functions:

1. **Proof of Originality** — Validated through cross-referenced audits (academic + industry).
2. **Methodological Transparency** — A breakdown of the ecosystem’s interdisciplinary logic.
3. **Contributor Reference** — To help collaborators, researchers, and practitioners understand the structure and apply it correctly.

> This is retail’s repair system.”

If you still think retail is about colors and counters — you haven’t read deep enough.  
This folder will fix that.
