## 🌬 What is Brand XD?

**Brand XD (Experience Design)** is the second pillar in the xAr Framework™.  
It’s how you design the **emotional gravity** of your business.  
The invisible force that builds trust, memory, and desire.

Where Business XD is logic — Brand XD is **atmosphere**.

## 🧠 Definition

> **Brand XD** is the craft of making your business emotionally real.  
> It turns your values, beliefs, and narrative into something **felt** across every touchpoint.

It evokes resonance by combining:
- **Emotion from Art**  
  (_Symbols, stories, culture, memory_)
- **Meaning from Science**  
  (_Cognitive behavior, psychology, brand perception_)

### 📐 Formula
```txt
Resonance = Emotion (Art) + Meaning (Science)
```
