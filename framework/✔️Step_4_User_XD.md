# 🔥 User XD (Fire)  
**Make It Feel Right**  
_This is what users touch, see, and experience. Craft the moments where they go, what they notice, how they feel._

## ⚙️ What is User XD?

**User XD (Experience Design)** is where emotional connection meets intuitive design.  
It’s not about decoration — it’s about human behavior, ease of use, and intentional engagement.

---

## 🧠 Definition

> **User XD** creates emotional, intuitive, and human-first environments  
> that engage, satisfy, and delight people in real space.

It achieves **engagement** by combining:
- **Journey from Design**  
  (_Pathways, perceptual coherence, narrative flow_)
- **Functionality from Engineering**  
  (_Ease, accessibility, spatial performance_)

---

### 📐 Formula:
```txt
Engagement = Journey (Design) + Functionality (Engineering)
```

## 🔍 Key Questions

These are the sensory prompts every designer must test for:

- **WHO** comes in?
- **WHERE** do they look first?
- **HOW** do they move through the space?
- **HOW** do they feel while inside?
- **HOW** do they leave and what do they remember?

## 💡 How to Know You’re Done

Ask your team:

- Can a first-time visitor move through without asking for help?
- Do people stop, look, and feel something?
- Are key moments clear, intentional, and branded?

If not — your User XD needs work.
