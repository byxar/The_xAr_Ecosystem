## 🌊 What is Flow XD?

**Flow XD (Experience Design)** is the choreography of everything.  
From how a customer walks in, to how a staff member restocks — it’s about motion.

In Flow, we design **the rhythm of retail**.

## 🧠 Definition

> **Flow XD** is the orchestration of how people, energy, and operations  
> move through your environment — without friction.

It enables smooth circulation by combining:
- **Emotion from Art**  
  (_Ambience, rhythm, sensorial cues_)
- **Intuition from Design**  
  (_Circulation logic, service choreography, zoning_)

### 📐 Formula
```txt
Fluidity = Emotion (Art) + Intuition (Design)
```

## 🔍 Key Questions

To create movement that feels good, ask:

- Where does the user enter — and what do they see first?
- How do staff navigate the space without clashing with customers?
- Where does friction happen — and what’s the flow fix?
- Are your customers wandering or journeying?
- Can a new staff member understand the logic in 5 minutes?
